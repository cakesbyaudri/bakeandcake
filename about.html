							<h3>INGREDIENTS FOR CAKE</h3>
							<p>
							- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
							<br>
							- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
							<br>
							- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
							<br>
							- 4 large eggs
							<br>
							- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
							<br>
							- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
							<br>
							- 1/2 teaspoon salt
							<br>
							- 1 cup whole milk
							<br>
							- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
							<br><br>
							Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter with an electric mixer until creamy, then gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, starting and ending with the flour mixture, and mix each addition just until combined, being careful not to overmix. Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans, dividing it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost and decorate as desired once the cakes are completely cool.

							<h3>INGREDIENTS FOR FROSTING</h3>
							<p>
							- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
							<br>
							- 4 cups powdered sugar
							<br>
							- 1/4 cup whole milk
							<br>
							- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
							<br>
							- Pinch of salt
							<br><br>
							
In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy, then gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the milk, vanilla extract, and salt, and beat the mixture on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk, one tablespoon at a time if the frosting is too thick, or more powdered sugar if it's too thin. Use a spatula to spread the frosting evenly over the cooled cakes.
